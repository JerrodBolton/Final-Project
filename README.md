## Objectives
- Ensure all pages after the landing page can navigate back to the landing page.
- Use CSS to create a professional look and feel for your web application.
- Understand the differences between Inline, Internal, and External CSS.

## Requirements
1. **Landing Page**:  
    - Create a landing page that allows navigation to all other pages (e.g., meme, game, palindrome, user input/validation, objectives page, table).  
    - Ensure every page can navigate back to the landing page.

2. **CSS Styling**:  
    - Link each page to a CSS file and apply styles defined in it.  
    - Your website should look professional and function properly when viewed through the [GitHub HTML previewer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).

3. **JavaScript Usage**:  
    - Use `innerHTML` for user validation and palindrome messages (no alerts).  
    - Use a form with a submit button for all user input.  
    - Do not use action listeners.  
    - Avoid placing JavaScript functions directly in HTML.

4. **Code Cleanup**:  
    - Remove all unused and example code (do not comment it out).
